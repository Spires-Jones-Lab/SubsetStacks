Readme.txtSubset-separateStacks.ijmThis macro finds the brightest 10 sections in the synapse channel of separated confocal stacks with 4 channels. Each channel needs to be in a separate folder.The steps before this macro in analysis of confocal image stacks are:1. Separate individual images in the series* Images from the confocal will be in .lif format. * There will be multiple images within each raw image file that is saved directly from the confocal. * To analyse these images we need to separate each individual image within the series saved from the confocal * To do this we use the ‘Lif_series_separator_colour.ijm’ macro in ImageJ.* When prompted click on the folder where the raw image series are saved.* Second prompt, click through where you want the separated images to be saved.2. Separate each individual image into its component channelsBefore we can segment, we need to have the channels separated. We can then apply the same segmentation parameters to all of those images from that channel. * Use the ‘Spilt tiff files into channel folders_CD_paraffin.ijm’ macro in ImageJ for this -with modified channel names to each experiment. * Select the folder where your separated images are saved.* The macro will will create a new folder for each channel and the will save each channel separated image into the appropriate folder. * Now is a good time to rename your images. MATLAB likes inputs where the naming convention is ‘ImageID-channelID’N.B. Don’t use underscores in your filename!!!* On Mac, highlight multiple files and rename all in one go rather than doing each one separately.
